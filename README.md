## 1. Purpose of the project
This project was both exciting and scary for me at the same time! I was very eager to build my very first web based game and the thought of being able to do this truely excited me. On the other hand the task became quite daunting as it was essential that I had completly grasped the essential basic concepts of the JavaScript language, something which I have struggled with up to now. With that being said, I managed to get the project where I wanted it to be and I am already looking forward to the next one!

I wanted this project to be a fun and easy going gaming experience for any user that came to the page. It consists of a fairly simple game called Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock! It is a slight twist on the original Rock, Paper, Scissors game with two extra parameters. The user makes their choice and play's against the computer in this game of chance and can see how well they are doing from the incrementing wins and losses displayed at the bottom of the page. 

The rules of the game are as follows: Rock crushes Scissors, Rock crushes Lizard, Paper covers Rock, Paper disproves Spock, Scissors cuts Paper, Scissors decapitates Lizard, Spock vaporizes Rock, Spock smashes Scissors, Lizard eats paper and Lizard poisons Spock! 

Once the page has been loaded the user is asked to make their choice and once a button is clicked the program will choose a random option from an array of choices. The user will them get an alert letting them know if they have won, lost or if there has been a draw. Then the user's score is updated accordingly.

Below is a screenshot the landing page.
